Predicting agricultural crop production in Tamil Nadu using Python and Machine Learning.

# 🌾 Crop Production Prediction in Tamil Nadu

A data science project that predicts crop production in Tamil Nadu using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).  
It explores how factors such as area, crop type, and rainfall affect agricultural output.

## 🔍 Overview
- Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Built a predictive model in Python to estimate production levels.  
- Evaluated model accuracy using R² and visualized results with Matplotlib and Seaborn.  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Jupyter Notebook
